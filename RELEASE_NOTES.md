### Version 25.10.0 - Oct 1, 2025 (The last gpaw-tools version)

* The -v and -h arguments of `gpawsolve.py` were not working. Fixed.
* Many corrections done in `gg.py`. It has become outdated for a while. There are many fixes now. They make gg.py run smoothly. Its chronic "stuck while running the simulation" problem is solved now.

* `gpawsolve.py` now gives an error message when running without input.

### Version 25.2.1 - Feb 3, 2025

* We forgot to change the version information in the code. So there is no v.25.2.0 :) Please use the corrected v25.2.1 version. Sorry for any inconvenience.
* `gpaw-tools` is moved to a new repository at [https://github.com/sblisesivdin/gpaw-tools](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/gpaw-tools). All links in the code are corrected.

### Version 24.6.1 - Jun 10, 2024

* Because the SPGlib dropped the ASE type Atoms object after their version 2.2.0, gpawsolve.py gives an error. From now on, the get_spacegroup() function call will be maintained by ASE. Because of this change, gpawsolve.py no more requires the `spglib` package.
* CONTRIBUTING.md file is updated.

### Version 24.6.0 - Jun 5, 2024

* The localisation feature now includes English, Turkish, German, French, Russian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.

* `nbands` value is added to LCAO calculations.
* `Magmom_single_atom` keyword is added.
* A new example, `Graphene-charged,` is added.

* Small corrections are done to EXX-related parts, XYYY formatted band result data output, optical RPA calculation, etc.
* Using `DielectricFunction` with frequencies.
* PW-EXX mode is removed. EXX can be used directly under PW.
* Mostly, no need to use `outdir` variable. However, it can still be used.
* Phonon calculation feature is added to `gg.py`.
* Phonopy version information can be viewed when using the -v argument.
* Energy consumption measurement with -e argument. This feature only works with Intel CPUs from the Sandy Bridge generation onward. Results are given in kWh!
* Restart -r, --restart argument is now depreceted. There is nothing to be restarted. Instead of the -r argument, the new keyword `Ground_calc` is introduced.
* Basic phonon dispersion calculation feature with Phonopy! At least it works for bulk Al. Please keep this in mind, as it is not very mature. (Thanks to Michael Lamparski for his help and MIT-licensed code that he shared.)
* Save figures in higher dpi.
* Fix some bugs, add a new variable, and rearrange some variables in `gg.py`.
* Add Energy_min variable. Energy_min and Energy_max variables are now working on both band and DOS figures.
* Remove unnecessary variables in the input file for the examples/Si-2atoms-optical example.
* Band structure data can now be exported in XYYYY type ASCII file (Thanks to Andrej Kesely). 
* Fixed some unused imports and local variables.
* Small fixes in the `gg.py` file.
* Adding `struct_from_file()` function for future usage.
* `gpawsolve.py` is not only a Python script anymore. The structure of the `gpawsolve.py` is rewritten. The calculations are related to a class named `gpawsolve`. Also, there are functions related to all possible calculations in this class as `structurecalc()`, `groundcalc()`, `elasticcalc()`, `doscalc()`, `bandcalc()`, `densitycalc()`, and `opticalcalc()`. The structure is still primitive, and code relies mostly on global variables; however, it is a start, and it will be easy to use when it is finished properly.
* From this release "-o" argument is deprecated. Code, all examples, and the related BASH script are fixed.

### Version 23.2.0 - Feb 1, 2023

* The DOS calculation part is changed completely. All calculations for DOS, PDOS, and RawPDOS are done with RawPDOS.
* A new variable is added: `DOS_convergence`.

* Correction of the output file that writes spacegroup and special points to the wrong folder.
* Making `do_all_examples.sh` script executable.

* All new variable changes are corrected, and new variables are added to `gg.py`.
* `simple_benchmark2021.py` is simplified and renamed as `simple_benchmark2023.py`.
* With time, `gpawsolve.py` uses many variables in it and in the input files. However, it does not have a proper naming convention for these variables. Also, some of the variable names are misleading the user. From this version, `gpawsolve.py` will use a special Snake_case (first letter of each variable is capitalized) variable for the input file variable usage. Variables that are affected: *mode -> Mode, fmaxval -> Max_F_tolerance, whichstrain -> Relax_cell, cut_off_energy -> Cut_off_energy, kpts_density -> Ground_kpts_dens, kpts_x -> Ground_kpts_x, kpts_y -> Ground_kpts_y, kpts_z -> Ground_kpts_y, gpts_density -> Ground_gpts_dens, gpts_x -> Ground_gpts_x, gpts_y -> Ground_gpts_y, gpts_z -> Ground_gpts_z, Hubbard -> Setup_params, band_path -> Band_path, band_npoints -> Band_npoints, gridref -> Refine_grid energy_max -> Energy_max, GWtype -> GW_type, GWkpoints -> GW_kpoints_list, GWtruncation -> GW_truncation, GWcut_off_energy -> GW_cut_off_energy, GWbandVB -> GW_valence_band_no, GWbandCB -> GW_conduction_band_no, GWppa -> GW_PPA, GWq0correction -> GW_q0_correction, GWnblock -> GW_nblocks_max, GWbandinterpolation -> GW_interpolate_band, opttype -> Opt_calc_type, optshift -> Opt_shift_en, optBSEvb -> Opt_BSE_valence, optBSEcb -> Opt_BSE_conduction, optBSEminEn -> Opt_BSE_min_en, optBSEmaxEn -> Opt_BSE_max_en, optBSEnumdata -> Opt_BSE_num_of_data, num_of_bands -> Opt_num_of_bands, optFDsmear -> Opt_FD_smearing, opteta -> Opt_eta, optdomega0 -> Opt_domega0, optomega2 -> Opt_omega2, optecut -> Opt_cut_of_energy, optnblocks -> Opt_nblocks, MPIcores -> MPI_cores*
